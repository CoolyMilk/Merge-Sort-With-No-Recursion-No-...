# Merge-Sort-With-No-Recursion-No-...

Hello there! Needed a fast sorting algorithm and tried to learn merge sort. I really like to come up with my own code based off desscriptions even though it's very likely it won't be even half as good as the best one. Any advice on programming practices and optimization would be greatly appreciated! Thank you
